### Local Search

Local search is based on RSS (`index.html` file). If you don't see the list of results

- Check RSS is working locally [`http://localhost:1313/index.xml`](http://localhost:1313/index.xml) (or `http://localhost:1313/<path from baseURL>/index.xml`).
- Do the same for the deployed site.
- Check local search is enabled in `hugo.toml`

    ```toml
    [params.search]
      disable = false
      localSearch = true
    ```

- Verify there is a `content/search.md` file with the `type: "search"` line in the [front matter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/).

### Archive Page

- Verify there is a `content/archives.md` file with the `type: "archives"` line in the [front matter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/).

### Google Tag Manager, Google Analytics, AdSense, etc

No need to integrate Google Analytics, AdSense, etc. code into your website. The theme has the support for Google Tag Manager (GTM) containerization. Include your GTM key in `hugo.toml` and the rest of integrations are done via [GTM website](https://tagmanager.google.com/#/home).

```toml
[params.googletagmanager]
  gtmid = "GTM-xxxxxx" # Google Tag Manager ID

```

Follow Google's instructions, they claim it takes them up to 48h to start showing data.

### Wrong i18n Translations

All translations are in the `i18n` directory in `theme/maupassant`. If there's an error, please open an [issue](https://github.com/bryndin/maupassant-hugo/issues), indicate the language and suggest the correct translation. Pull requests are always welcome.

## Credits

**The Maupassant theme** was originally created by [Cho](https://github.com/pagecho/maupassant) for the [Typecho](https://github.com/typecho/typecho) PHP blogging platform. It has been ported to multiple platforms, including Hugo. The initial Hugo port was created by [JokerQyou](https://github.com/JokerQyou) and further improved by [Flysnow-org](https://github.com/flysnow-org). These versions are primarily targeted at an oriental audience and offer good integrations with Chinese services.

"Maupassant IC" is an enhanced version tailored for an international audience.
