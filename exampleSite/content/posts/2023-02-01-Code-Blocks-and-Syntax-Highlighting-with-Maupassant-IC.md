One of the essential features of any blogging theme is code blocks and syntax highlighting. As a blogger, you want to share your code with your audience in a clear and readable format. Maupassant IC has got you covered!

## Supported Languages

Maupassant IC uses Chroma, a popular syntax highlighting engine, to support a wide range of programming languages. You can find the full list of supported languages on the [Hugo documentation website](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#list-of-chroma-highlighting-languages).

## Code Blocks with Copy to Clipboard

In Maupassant IC, code blocks are beautifully formatted with syntax highlighting, and they come with a convenient "copy to clipboard" button. This makes it easy for your readers to copy and paste your code into their own projects.

Here are some sample code blocks in different programming languages:

### Go

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

### Python

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

### Java

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### Bash

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

As you can see, the code blocks are nicely formatted with syntax highlighting, and the "copy to clipboard" button makes it easy to copy the code.

## Conclusion

Maupassant IC makes it easy to share your code with your audience in a clear and readable format. With support for a wide range of programming languages and a convenient "copy to clipboard" button, you can focus on sharing your knowledge and expertise with the world.
